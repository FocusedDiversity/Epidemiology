All configuration variables should be included in config files in the [config folder](../epidem/config). As a best practice, include configuration variables for a specific experiment/model/dataset in a `config/[experiment|model|dataset_name].py` config file. 

The config folder contains a package level config file `config/package.py` for package level config variables. Additionally, there is a `config/csse_covid19.py` config file for CSSE COVID-19 Dataset related config variables as an example.
